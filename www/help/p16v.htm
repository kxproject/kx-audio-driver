<h3>Audigy2 / P16V Routings</h3>

<h4>

<p class=Darken>Audigy2 routings</p>

<p>Audigy2-based cards have slightly more complicated signal flow
compared to 10k1 and Audigy 1 boards (shown on the following diagram).</p>

<img width=747 height=303 src="images/p16v.gif">

<p>That is, there's a special unit dealing with 24/96 audio streams called 'p16v'.
This unit is capable of recording incoming SPDIF and I2S streams in 24/96 mode.
The kX Audio driver enables both p16v and 10k2 to access inputs and outputs by
default (as shown above). However, the actual hardware routing is even more complex.
In the default mode the Audigy2 chip acts as Audigy1 with p16v unit operating
in parallel mode.
</p>

<p>By default, p16v-&gt;10k2 path is
disabled. It is necessary to load the ‘p16v’ effect into the kX DSP window in order
to enable it. For example, if you wish to process p16v output and add some
10k2-based reverb, use the following routing:</p>

<p>(Note: ‘swap front &amp; rear’ option
might affect the actual p16v outputs you will be using. For instance, in this
case ‘swap’ is active, that’s why p16v.‘in7/in8’ are used instead of p16v. ‘in0/in1’.
The input numbers correspond to particular i2s/spdif outputs listed in our ‘I/O
Assignment guide’).</p>

<p class=Darken>Recording</p>

<p>P16v 24/96 audio recording uses the same
considerations mentioned in our ‘Direct SPDIF Recording guide’. That is, the
sampling rate is not auto-detected and it is up to the user to choose the
appropriate sampling rate in the audio recording application. Note: you may need
to re-assign the sampling rate after recording (not 'resample' the audio, but just
re-assign the sampling rate :)).</p>

<h5><b>NOTE</b>: the 'p16v' codename was taken from the opensource.creative.com driver (as well as
codenames 'Alice3' and 'Apollo').</h5>

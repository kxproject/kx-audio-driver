        kxctrl is cross-platform now<br>
        Most of the SDK sources released under GPL (GNU Public License)<br>
        SDK license agreement updated<br>
        Since the mixer is no longer in system32 folder, kFile::get_full_skin_path function is used (see efx-tube example)<br>

        MFC Timer uses UINT_PTR instead of UINT, if your code uses timer, update accordingly (see 'dynamica' example)<br>
        kxparam_t is 'int' for x64 builds, thus, most DSP effects need to be updated<br>
        iKXPlugin::get_plugin_presets() returns kxparam_t* instead of char * (all plugins need to be updated!)<br>
        Most char pointers updated to 'const char *'<br>

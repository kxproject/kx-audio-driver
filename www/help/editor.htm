Before reading this topic it's recomended to take a quick look at some 
E-mu/Creative papers/patents considering Emu10kx DSP,
And highly recommended to read &quot;As10k1 Manual&quot; written by Daniel Bertrand
for his As10k1 Assembler.

Dane Syntax Tips.
-----------------  

Dane Language is use a mix of classic asm and classic C-like syntax
(maybe too mad mix).

Dane DSP Program is a set of instructions and registers to be used in 
that instructions. (doh..)

You may treat DSP Program like function which dsp calls every sample 
cycle feeding it with samples of sound data.

More comments later, let's jump into syntax right now...
-----------------  

;registers declaration

Each program must have atleast one input and one output register to
be able to process sound data.

Input is a register where you read sound sample from and output is a
register you should write processed sample to.

Dane register declaration is C-like:

; declare input register:
input a; 
; will allocate one register from dsp memory and says to
; the driver that it is input of the program

; output
output b;

You just must to keep in mind the important difference from C,
semicolon ';' -
is not the end of expression like in C, but the start of ;comments.
Anything after ';' until next line will be ignored by dane:
output x; output y
; this will produce only one output register

However you can declare more then one register of the same type in one line 
using comma ',':
input k, l, m, n; declares four inputs.

Also you may not use ';' at all, dividing declarations just with newline
; followed lines produce one input and one output
input i1
output o1


Of coarse you will need some other register where you can store
intermediate values and some constants needed for effect's algorithm 
calculation.
The main basic types of such registers are static and temp:

; example
static s;
temp t

Use static when you want register to store its value for next sample cycle
(in other words value of static register is preserved for next sample cycle).

Use temp when you need value only for current sample cycle, the value of this 
type of registers is preserved only during one sample cycle and it is
unpredictable for the next sample cycle.

Another important type of the register you may need is constant.
Constant registers are defined with const keyword:
;defines constant with 0.5 value 
const c = 0.5

Also you may avoid declaration of constant and use numeric values right in code
(see later). Using numeric value in code causes Dane to automatically allocate
constant register in DSP memory.  

As well as you can assign numeric value to constant, you can initialize
static register with value (as always).
; static intitialized to 0.25
static quarter = 0.25;


Next type: Control.
This type implemented mostly for future compability, when it will
say to Dane export some header file for kX DSP Plugin.
For now it is the same as static except two things:
It is read-only for dsp code (like const) and its value can be changed
from the host only.
And control register must be initialized with some value
; control register 
control level = 1
control nolevel; error!

-----------------

Tip: If you are not sure which register type from above ones to use,
use static and you'll naver make a mistake. 

-----------------

As you can see Dane is not case sensitive language, so foolowed
declarations do the same job:
static s;
STATIC s;
static S;
sTaTic S;

-----------------

Using Delays.

I will not get into details of using fx8010's 'tank memory',
you can get much deeper guide from 'As10k1 Manual' (thanks to 
Daniel for the great work) and Patents.

Just some details on declaring and using delays/tankmemory access registers
in Dane.

It's not so user friendly to use delays in Dane, but i tryed to keep
Dane syntax simple, and we have what we got.

At first you should declare/request the whole amount of Tank memory (aka TRAM)
you want to use in program:

; allocate 834 samples in internal tank memory:
itramsize 834;

; allocate the number of samples in external tram:
xtramsize 834;
; or
xtramsize 0x342;

Then you don't need to declare delayline, it's automatically allocated
when you are creating tram write access register.
; declare external tram write access register
xdelay write delayinput at 0x888;
; above statement allocates tram write registers pair
; with address of tram to write with offset 0x888 (2184 samples)
; + offset of tram allocated for program (doh..)

Did you remember that tram access requires two registers actually?
Since TRAM Access Data Register and TRAM Access Data Register always
go together let's use the term &quot;TRAM Access Pair&quot;.

;In code you access Data register using symbol you declared access with,
;and access Address register with same symbol after '&amp;' operator:  
idelay write idw at 0x00; in most cases first tram of the programm write will have offset 0 
; and later in code
&quot;idw&quot; will represent DATA register and
&quot;&amp;idw&quot; will represnt ADDRESS register.

(compare with as10k1 syntax where &quot;idw&quot; will be DATA too, but ADDRESS will be
represented with &quot;idw.a&quot; symbol)

Also don't mess Dane '&amp;' operator with  C/C++ '&amp;' operator:
In C - &quot;&amp;symbol&quot; means address of memory where value of &quot;symbol&quot; located,
but in Dane &quot;&amp;symbol&quot; means address of tram memory where &quot;symbol&quot; points
to!

;Let's declare Tank Memory Read Access Pair:
xdelay read delayout at 0x1000;

So to get an 0x2000 samples delay line we should:
;declare write register
idelay write d at 0x0000;
;declare read register 
idelay read dr at 0x2000;
; Later in code writing to d and reading from dr
; we will get desired 0x2000 samples delay line

You can convert samples into seconds using equation
'seconds = samples / 48000' - since emu10kx DSP has 48kHz fixed sample rate. 
(Dane does not support values in seconds yet, -&gt; todo)

Two important difficulties of using Delays/TankMemory with Dane.

1. Tram access pairs are declared with address offset within whole TRAM
requested for program.
So to get two delay lines with size of (for example) 2 seconds
we should do something like:

xtramsize 0x2EE01; 0x2EE01 = 2 * 2 * 48000 + 1
xdelay write delayline1write at 0x00000;
xdelay read delayline1write at 0x17700; 0x17700 = 2 * 48000
xdelay write delayline2write at 0x17701; 0x17701 = 2 * 48000 + 1  
xdelay read delayline1write at 0x2EE01; 0x2EDF7 = 0x17701 + 2 * 48000    

Looks very weird, but see echo1 and chorus, it's a bit simplier that it seems.

2. Tram access pairs are declared with address offset within whole TRAM
requested for program, but when we'll try to access ADDRESS register 
from fx8010 code (at runtime) it will have other value:

addressvalue = offset_of_reg_within_pgm + offset_of_tram_allocated_for_pgm

This cannot be simply avoided (at least with asm - compiler maybe),
but good example trick is shown in chorus program source (pgms\chorus1\chor14ti.da). 

Tip: Don't forget to declare delays with 'at' instead of '='!

Future: Of coarse i think of making usage of delay lines with Dane simplier.

-----------------
       
Other register declaration keywords. 

wscl, iscl, oscl, intr, coarse.
They are implemented for RIFX compability and will be removed (or changed)
in future, don't use them!

-----------------

Reserved keywords and operators: 

&quot;rsaw&quot;.        

-----------------   

DSP and Numeric Values.

As you know fx8010 is a 32 bit fixed-point DSP,
so we need some tips on using numeric values.

At first read fixed-point math relaited stuff in 'As10k1 Manual',
then read followed stuff considering Dane:

1. Dane is kind of typeless language, since in most cases values
are stored in 32 bit register.

2. Default number format is fractional (fixed-point),
i.e. 1, 1.0, 1., 0.5, 0.2 etc. stored as 32 bit fractionals.

3. Fractional numbers have range from -1.0 to 1.0

4. Numbers having value more then 1 or less then -1 are truncated
to and stored as 32 bit integers.

5. To assign an integer to a register used C-like hex digit format
starting with '0x' (e.g. 0x3fff5555)

6. Fractional 0 and integer 0 are the same values.

Some examples:

static fone = 1; stored as 0x7fffffff
static ione = 0x1; stored as 0x00000001
control half = 0.5; stored as 0x3fffffff
control minfract = -1; stored as 0x80000000
const int = 1024; stored as 0x00000400
const notfract = 5.2; truncated and stored as 0x00000005

Also see some numbers tips in next section.

-----------------   

Code Syntax.

Code represented with set of instructions in followed format

OPCODE R, A, X, Y

where OPCODE is DSP instruction mnemonic (e.g MACS ;),
and R, A, X, Y operands representing registers.

What can be used as operand:

1. Symbol representing register you declared before.
2. Any numeric value (with convenions described in 'DSP and Numeric Values' above).

Examples:

;----------
input in;
output out;

;code
macs out, in, 0, 0
; writes value of 'in' register to 'out' register
; i.e. out = in + 0 * 0 or just out = in

;----------
static S
const half = 0.5

MACW	s, 0xcccccccc, s, HALF;
; in fractional tirms: s = -0.40 + s * 0.5
; in integer: s = 0xcccccccc + s * 0x3fffffff


-----------

Note: '1' (as well as '1.' and '1.0') are not always undestantood by Dane as
fractional 1 in code, for example using 1 as Y operand in MACINTS instruction
cause Dane to use value 0x1 instead of 0x7fffffff.
Example:
           
static a;           
const c = 1.0;

MACS	a, 0, c, 1.0;		a = c * 0x7fffffff
MACINTS a, 0, c, 1.0;		a = c * 0x00000001 

(Guide to follow / Subject to change)

-----------

END Keyword.

Dane DSP Programm must be ended with end keyword,
and all after end will be ignored.

-----------


Critical notes on Beta verion of Dane.

1. (absolute) Use all of input/output registers you've declared in code,
living unused may cause unexpected execution of program.
Comment out or remove unused register of such type.

2. Do not use input registers in code more then once,
this limitation relaited to current format of binary dsp program
(atleast rfx one) and may cause unexpected execution.

3. Do not use input/output registers in single instruction
more then once, in future it may cause unpredictable DSP behaviour
due to nature of Emu10kx architecture.
(For now it's ok to do this).

4. Dane does not check if your program resources will fit
into available target dsp resources. So check it yourself
if program is built successful but cannot be loaded.

Stuff. 

Yep, Dane is pretty simple (so i prefer to call it Translator instead 
of Assembler).

------------
Anyway.  

Don't fear to expirement with it because:
1. You don't burn you card (well, speakers maybe ;)
2. Dane can determine and notify you of about 300 errors
you could have made in *.da program
